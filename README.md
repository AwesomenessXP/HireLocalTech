# Hire Local Tech

**Hire Local Tech** is on a mission to help talented people land legit tech work — without leaving home. We believe you shouldn’t have to move to a big city just to build a solid career in tech. Small towns deserve great talent too — and we’re here to make that happen.

This isn’t some generic job board. It’s a gritty, no-BS launchpad for the Central Valley’s next generation of builders. We’re connecting local devs, students, and self-taught hackers with real projects, real startups, and real opportunities — no recruiters, no corporate fluff. Just straight-up work that matters.

We’re kicking things off with tech because it’s growing fast and still super disconnected out here. But the bigger vision? Bring better hiring tools to *every* industry in the Valley — and beyond.

> Yep, niche job boards *do* work — even in overlooked places like California’s Central Valley. Especially here.

## 🧠 Why Local-First Hiring Actually Works

| What’s Broken                   | Why Local Matters                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hiring locally is hard**     | Smaller markets get ignored by big platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed — so companies can’t find solid local candidates.                  |
| **SEO is way easier**          | Try ranking for “Remote Software Engineer” — good luck. But “Fresno entry-level jobs”? You can own that search.                          |
| **Small businesses can’t compete** | Local companies don’t have the time or budget to fight for attention on national job boards. They need tools built just for them.         |
